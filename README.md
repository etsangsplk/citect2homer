# citect2homer
Converts data from Citect (SCADA) format into HOMER (hybrid power systems simulation) using TCL (http://wiki.tcl.tk).

Citect is a SCADA package currently sold by Schneider and was developed
in Australia. Its fairly common in a variety of industries.

HOMER (www.homerenergy.com) is the standard modelling package for
hybrid power systems. If you get really excited you might consider
ASIM (www.powerwater.com.au/solardiesel) as an extension (not a 
replacement)/
